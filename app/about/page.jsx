          <p className="my-9">
          Exploring different fields during my first year of college, software development quickly caught my attention by
          seeing stuff made by my seniors. 
          I joined some Tech Clubs (ACM and ISTE), eager to immerse myself in the world of tech and to learn more. 
          As I delved deeper into it, I found it to be an incredibly dynamic pursuit. 
          The ability to create something tangible from lines of code fascinated me, 
          and I was drawn to the endless possibilities it offered.
          Though I didn&apos;t remained for long in the clubs due to looming academics, I connected with
          like-minded individuals during my time there who shared the same passion for technology. 
          Collaborating on projects, attending hackathons , and participating in 
          late night tech talks fueled my enthusiasm and accelerated my learning journey. 
          I found joy in building applications, and experimenting with new tech stacks.

          <h4 className="my-10 font-InterBold">What&apos;s to come</h4>

          <p className="my-10">
            As an cse engineer, I have a strong passion for technology and I&apos;m
            always on the lookout for the latest developments and trends. I&apos;m
            particularly interested in exploring how backend systems work behind the scenes,
            and how companies build scalable and resilient architectures. In the future, I
            hope to continue pushing the boundaries of technology,
            and to use my skills to create innovative solutions that make a real
            impact to society. I&apos;m excited to see where this journey takes me, and
            I look forward to sharing my experiences and insights along the way. 
            Till then keep iterating! ðŸ¥¸
